# GUIDELINES FOR CONTRIBUTING NEW UPDATES

# Due to a tight schedule, you can contribute the updates on your own without peer-review. 
# If there appear to be conflicts with master-branch, reach out to other team members via Teams before submitting.
# Allways keep your branch up to date from the master-branch.
# Create a new backup (branch) everytime a new functionality has been marked "done".
